		<h2><span> OVERVIEW </span></h2>
		<p> Belka (Белка, <em> literally, "squirrel", or alternatively "Whitey" </em>) and Strelka (Стрелка, <em> "little arrow" </em>) spent a day in space aboard <b> Korabl-Sputnik 2 (Sputnik 5)</b> on <b> 19 August 1960</b> before safely returning to Earth. They are the first higher living organisms to survive in outer space.  </p>

		<h2><span> POST-TRAVEL </span></h2>
		<p> Strelka went on to have six puppies with a male dog named Pushok who participated in many ground-based space experiments, but never made it into space.[3] One of the puppies was named Pushinka (Пушинка, "Fluffy") and was presented to President John F. Kennedy by Nikita Khrushchev in 1961. A Cold War romance bloomed between Pushinka and a Kennedy dog named Charlie, resulting in the birth of four puppies that JFK referred to jokingly as pupniks.[4] Two of their puppies, Butterfly and Streaker, were given away to children in the Midwest. The other two puppies, White Tips and Blackie, stayed at the Kennedy home on Squaw Island but were eventually given away to family friends.[3] Pushinka's descendants were still living at least as of 2015.[5] A photo of descendants of some of the Space Dogs is on display at the Zvezda Museum in Tomilino outside Moscow. </p>

		<p> Space Dogs (a.k.a. Belka & Strelka — Star Dogs, original: Белка и Стрелка. Звёздные собаки, Belka i Strelka. Zvyozdnye sobaki) is a 2010 Russian computer-animated adventure comedy film. The film is based on the Soviet space dogs Belka and Strelka, and honors the first animals who survived an orbital space trip, the Korabl-Sputnik 2 flight in August, 1960. In Poland it became the leader of the box-office on its first weekend, although in the United States it grossed poorly, making only $14,408 due to its limited release.</p>
